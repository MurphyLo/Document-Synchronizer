Player5 has been very cautious and has not accused anyone specifically, which is a common strategy for werewolves to avoid suspicion. Player7 claimed to be the Seer and accused Player4, but his claim was contradicted by Player4 who turned out to be a werewolf. This makes me suspect that Player7 might be the remaining werewolf trying to mislead us. Therefore, I think Player7 is the most suspicious and should be poisoned. My step-by-step thought process: 1. Identify the remaining players and their roles based on the game history. 2. Analyze their behaviors and statements to identify any suspicious activities. 3. Decide to poison the most suspicious player to protect the village."
