Looking at my past experiences, in similar situations where there is a conflict between two players over a role, the one who is lying is often a werewolf. Therefore, I should vote to eliminate either Player6 or Player7. However, I need to consider the possibility that both of them are villagers and the werewolves are trying to create confusion. 4.

Considering this, I think it's more likely that either Player6 or Player7 is a werewolf. 4. Since Player1 was the one who was attacked by the werewolves and both Player6 and Player7 claimed to protect Player1, it's possible that the werewolves are trying to frame the real guard.
