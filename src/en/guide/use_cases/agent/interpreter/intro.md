# Data Interpreter (DI)

## What is Data Interpreter

Data Interpreter is an agent who solves data-related problems through codes. It understands user requirements, makes plans, writes codes for execution, and uses tools if necessary. These capabilities enable it to tackle a wide range of scenarios. Feel free to check out [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18679) and the examples below.

## Example List

- [Data visualization](./data_visualization.md)
- [Machine learning modeling](./machine_learning.md)
- [Machine learning with tools](./machine_learning_with_tools.md)
- [Image background removal](./image_removebg.md)
- [Solve math problems](./solve_mathematical_problems.md)
- [Receipt OCR](./ocr_receipt.md)
- [Tool usage: web page imitation](./imitate_webpage.md)
- [Tool usage: web crawling](./crawl_webpage.md)
- [Tool usage: text2image](./text2image.md)
- [Tool usage: email summarization and response](./email_summary.md)
- More on the way!

## Note

If you want to save the Jupyter Notebook file and the results of the plan at runtime for future reference and analysis, you can refer to the code of the [Data visualization](./data_visualization.md) example.
