# MetaGPT: The Multi-Agent Framework

<b>Assign different roles to GPTs to form a collaborative software entity for complex tasks.</b>

1. MetaGPT takes a **one line requirement** as input and outputs **user stories / competitive analysis / requirements / data structures / APIs / documents, etc.**
2. Internally, MetaGPT includes **product managers / architects / project managers / engineers.** It provides the entire process of a **software company along with carefully orchestrated SOPs.**
   1. `Code = SOP(Team)` is the core philosophy. We materialize SOP and apply it to teams composed of LLMs.

MetaGPT started as a software company, but its capabilities are not limited to that. You can use this multi-agent framework in your own scenario to build your own application. For details, you can refer to [Researcher](../use_cases/agent/researcher) under **Use Cases**. Let's do it.

## Examples (fully generated by GPT-4)

For example, if you type `metagpt "Design a RecSys like Toutiao"`, you would get many outputs, one of them is data & api design

It costs approximately **$0.2** (in GPT-4 API fees) to generate one example with analysis and design, and around **$2.0** for a full project.
