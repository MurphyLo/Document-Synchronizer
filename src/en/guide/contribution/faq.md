## Contribution FAQ

### How to allow maintainers to modify my PR?

Generally, we recommend that reviewers first provide feedback on the PR through comments, and then submitters submit again to iterate and get a qualified PR. In special cases, maintainers can also modify the PR directly to merge it faster.

You can check [Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers] on the right side of the PR page to allow maintainers to modify your PR directly. If you encounter permission issues, you can refer to [GitHub allows changes to PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)

### Why was my issue or PR closed?

Generally, there are several situations

- Issues or PRs have been out of date (30 days) and the creator has not followed up on them
- Issues have been resolved and no follow-up is required
- PR content has been implemented in other merged PRs and no need to submit again
- Content seriously does not conform to the issue or PR creation template format or code of conduct

Generally, we will respond and explain the reason before closing it. The creator can open it again if necessary and is welcome to continue the discussion.

### Do I have to follow the Issue or PR template format to fill in and create it?

We strongly urge creators to submit according to the corresponding template format, which will help us have a clearer understanding of the issue or PR and help us follow up more efficiently.

If some content in the template is missing, it is acceptable. In general, we expect creators to provide as complete information as possible.

### Why is there no response to my issue or PR?

We will arrange for the trail engineer to check the new updates of the issue or PR regularly and in a timely manner. However, there may be some delays due to scheduling and complexity issues. We recommend that if you are clear about the modules involved in your issue or PR, you can directly invite the [Reference Reviewer] in the [Contribution Guidelines](contribution_guidelines.md). Furthermore, you can also post the corresponding issue or PR in the discord or WeChat group for discussion.
